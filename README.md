<h1 align="center">Celebrity DNS Block List</h1>

This block list was created to complement the No Celebrity Goggles project, and further aims to help combat the underlying influence pop culture and celebrities have on our society. This block list is best used alongside the No Celebrity Goggles, which can be found [here](https://search.brave.com/goggles/discover?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FOmpanime%2FNo-Celebrity-Goggles%2Fmain%2FNo%2520Celebrity%2520Goggles)

Simply copy & paste this link (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ompanime/Celebrity-Block-List/main/Celebrity%20DNS%20Block%20List) as an entry to your DNS block list!

This block list is publicly available at no cost to the user, and is suitable for modification and redistribution under the GNU General Public License v3.0. Leaving this project open sourced will allow others to improve on an already established project/codebase.

I hope that this project will improve your life!
